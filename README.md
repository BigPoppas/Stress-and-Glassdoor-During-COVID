# Stress Mentions in Glassdoor Reviews: Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19

## Project Description

This research project aims to extract mentions of stress from Glassdoor reviews and analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the working environment and its employees. We're leveraging data on COVID-19 statistics and policy responses, along with features extracted from the reviews, to understand the correlation between the pandemic and employee well-being.
